# Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm Implementation
Overview:
This repository presents an optimized implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal. BFS is a fundamental algorithm for exploring and discovering nodes in a graph by systematically visiting each level of the graph's structure. This implementation provides an efficient and parallelized approach to BFS traversal.

Features:
Parallelization: Utilizes parallel computing paradigms such as MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to enhance the performance of BFS traversal across distributed memory, shared memory, and GPU architectures.

Scalability: Designed to handle large-scale graphs efficiently by distributing traversal tasks across multiple processing units, enabling expedited exploration of extensive graph structures.

Versatility: Offers flexibility in deployment, allowing users to choose the appropriate parallel computing framework based on the available hardware resources and performance requirements.

Usage:
MPI Implementation:
Compile the MPI version of BFS using a suitable MPI compiler.
Execute the compiled binary on a cluster with MPI support to distribute traversal tasks across multiple nodes.
OpenMP Parallelization:
Compile the OpenMP version of BFS using a compatible compiler with OpenMP support.
Adjust the number of threads via environment variables or compiler directives to optimize performance for your system configuration.
CUDA Acceleration:
Compile the CUDA version of BFS using the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.
Ensure proper configuration of CUDA runtime settings and device selection for optimal GPU utilization.
